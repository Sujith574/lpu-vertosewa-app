NCC INFORMATION MANUAL
======================================================================
National Cadet Corps is a Tri-Services Organisation comprising the Army, Navy and Air 
Force, engaged in grooming the youth – ‘The Leaders of Tomorrow’ – into disciplined and 
patriotic citizens. The genesis of the NCC can be traced back to the First World War when 
the Britishers created the University Corps as the second line of defence and to have a large 
pool of trained youth available for employment into the Armed Forces.  
                     After independence the present day NCC under the Ministry of Defence came 
into existence on 16 Apr 1948 through NCC act XXXI, 1948. NCC was formally inaugurated 
on 15 Jul 1948 as soon as the schools and colleges reopened after summer vacation. The Girls 
Division of the NCC was started in Jul 1949. In 1950 Air Wing was added on 01 Apr with 
one Air squadron each at Bombay and Kolkata. The Naval Wing of the NCC was raised in 
Jul 1952, thus completing the true representation of all services in the Corps. Presently, NCC 
has approximately 13 Lakhs Cadets under its fold.

National Song 

    The song Vande Mataram, composed in Sanskrit by Bankimchandra Chatterji, was a source of 
inspiration to the people in their struggle for freedom. It has an equal status with Jana-gana-mana. The 
first political occasion when it was sung was the 1896 session of the Indian National Congress. The 
following is the text of its first stanza: 

Vande Mataram! 
Sujalam, suphalam, malayaja shitalam, 
Shasyashyamalam, Mataram! 
Vande Mataram! 
Shubhrajyotsna pulakitayaminim, 
Phullakusumita drumadala shobhinim, 
Suhasinim sumadhura bhashinim, 
Sukhadam varadam, Mataram! 
Vande Mataram, Vande Mataram! 

    The English translation of the stanza rendered by Sri Aurobindo in prose 1 is: 

I bow to thee, Mother, 
richly-watered, richly-fruited, 
cool with the winds of the south, 
dark with the crops of the harvests, 
The Mother! 
Her nights rejoicing in the glory of the moonlight, 
her lands clothed beautifully with her trees in flowering bloom, 
sweet of laughter, sweet of speech, 
The Mother, giver of boons, giver of bliss. 

 

 



National Game 

 

    India has conquered the podium when it comes to the game of Hockey. Our nation has an excellent 
record with eight Olympic gold medals. Indian hockey's golden period was from 1928-56, when the 
Indian hockey team won six successive Olympic gold medals. Team also won the 1975 World Cup 
besides two more medals (silver and a bronze). The Indian Hockey Federation (External website that 
opens in a new window) gained global affiliation in 1927 and joined the International Hockey 
Federation (FIH) (External website that opens in a new window).  
 
    Thus began the history of Indian Hockey Federation as India entered the Olympics to begin its 
golden saga. The tour was a huge success with India winning 18 out of the 21 matches and the 
legendary Dhyan Chand was the cynosure of all the eyes scoring over 100 goals of the 192 Indian 
accounted for. The match began in Amsterdam in 1928 and India went on a winning spree in Los 
Angeles in 1932 and Berlin in 1936 and thus bagged a hat-trick of gold medals at the Olympics.  
 
    Post Indian Independence; the Indian team achieved another hat-trick of gold medals at the 1948 
London Olympics, 1952 Helsinki Games and the Melbourne Olympics.  
 
    During the Golden Era, India played 24 Olympic matches, won all 24, scored 178 goals (at an 
average of 7.43 goals per match) and conceded only 7 goals. The two other gold medals for India 
came in the 1964 Tokyo Olympics and the 1980 Moscow Olympics. 

National Anthem 

    The National Anthem of India is played or sung on various occasions. Instructions have been issued 
from time to time about the correct versions of the Anthem, the occasions on which these are to be 
played or sung, and about the need for paying respect to the anthem by observance of proper decorum 
on such occasions. The substance of these instructions has been embodied in this information sheet 
for general information and guidance. 

The National Anthem - Full & Short Versions 

    The composition consisting of the words and music of the first stanza of the late poetRabindra Nath 
Tagore's song known as "Jana Gana Mana" is the National Anthem of India. It reads as follows: 

Jana-gana-mana-adhinayaka, jaya he 
Bharata-bhagya-vidhata. 
Punjab-Sindh-Gujarat-Maratha 
Dravida-Utkala-Banga 

 



Vindhya-Himachala-Yamuna-Ganga 
Uchchala-Jaladhi-taranga. 
Tava shubha name jage, 
Tava shubha asisa mage, 
Gahe tava jaya gatha, 
Jana-gana-mangala-dayaka jaya he 
Bharata-bhagya-vidhata. 
Jaya he, jaya he, jaya he, 
Jaya jaya jaya, jaya he! 

    The above is the full version of the Anthem and its playing time is approximately 52 seconds. 
 
A short version consisting of the first and last lines of the National Anthem is also played on certain 
occasions. It reads as follows: 

Jana-gana-mana-adhinayaka, jaya he 
Bharata-bhagya-vidhata. 
Jaya he, jaya he, jaya he, 
Jaya jaya jaya, jaya he! 

    Playing time of the short version is about 20 seconds. The following is Tagore's English rendering 
of the anthem: 

Thou art the ruler of the minds of all people, 
Dispenser of India's destiny. 
Thy name rouses the hearts of Punjab, Sind, 
Gujarat and Maratha, 
Of the Dravida and Orissa and Bengal; 
It echoes in the hills of the Vindhyas and Himalayas, 
mingles in the music of Jamuna and Ganges and is 
chanted by the waves of the Indian Sea. 
They pray for thy blessings and sing thy praise. 
The saving of all people waits in thy hand, 
Thou dispenser of India's destiny. 
Victory, victory, victory to thee. 

    The occasions on which the full versions or the short version will be played have been indicated at 
the appropriate places in these instructions. 

Playing of the Anthem 

The full version of the Anthem shall be played on the following occasions: 

 

Civil and Military investitures; 

 

 



When National Salute (which means the Command "Rashtriya Salute Salami Shastr" to the 
accompaniment of the National Anthem is given on ceremonial occasions to the President or to the 
Governor/Lieutenant Governor within their respective States/Union Territories; 

 

During parades irrespective of whether any of the dignitaries referred to in (ii) above is present or not; 

 

On arrival of the President at formal State functions and other functions organized by the Government 
and mass functions and on his departure from such functions; 

 

Immediately before and after the President addresses the Nation over All India Radio; 

 

On arrival of the Governor/Lieutenant Governor at formal State functions within his State/Union 
Territory and on his departure from such functions; 

 

When the National Flag is brought on parade; 

 

When the Regimental Colours are presented; 

 

For hoisting of colours in the Navy. 

 

The short version of the Anthem shall be played when drinking toasts in Messes. 

 

The Anthem shall be played on any other occasion for which special orders have been issued by the 
Government of India. 

 

Normally the Anthem shall not be played for the Prime Minister, though there may be special 
occasions when it may be played. 

 

When the National Anthem is played by a band, the Anthem will be preceded by a roll of drums to 
assist the audience to know that the National Anthem is going to be played, unless there is some other 
specific indication that the National Anthem is about to be played, as for example, when fanfares are 
sounded before the National Anthem is played, or when toasts are drunk to the accompaniment of the 

 



National Anthem or when the National Anthem constitutes the National Salute given by a Guard of 
Honour. The duration of the roll, in terms of marching drill, will be 7 paces in slow march. The roll 
will start slowly, ascend to as loud a volume as possible and then gradually decreases to original 
softness, but remaining audible until the seventh beat. One beat rest will then be observed before 
commencing the National Anthem. 

 

Mass Singing of the Anthem 

The full version of the Anthem shall be played accompanied by mass singing on the following 
occasions: 

 

On the unfurling of the National Flag, on cultural occasions or ceremonial functions other than 
parades. (This could be arranged by having a choir or adequate size, suitably stationed, which would 
be trained to coordinate its singing with the band etc. There should be an adequate public audition 
system so that the gathering in various enclosures can sing in unison with the choir); 

 

On arrival of the President at any Government or Public function (but excluding formal State 
functions and mess functions) and also immediately before his departure from such functions. 

 

On all occasions when the National Anthem is sung, the full version shall be recited accompanied by 
mass singing. 

 

The Anthem may be sung on occasions which, although not strictly ceremonial, are nevertheless 
invested with significance because of the presence of Ministers etc. The singing of the Anthem on 
such occasions (with or without the accompaniment of an instruments) accompanied by mass singing 
is desirable. 

 

It is not possible to give an exhaustive list of occasions on which the singing (as distinct from playing) 
of the Anthem can be permitted. But there is no objection to the singing of the Anthem accompanied 
by mass singing so long as it is done with due respect as a salutation to the motherland and proper 
decorum is maintained. 

 

In all schools, the day's work may begin with community singing of the anthem. School authorities 
should make adequate provision in their programmes for popularising the singing of the Anthem and 
promoting respect for the National Flag among students. 

General 

 



Whenever the Anthem is sung or played, the audience shall stand to attention. However, when in the 
course of a newsreel or documentary the Anthem is played as a part of the film, it is not expected of 
the audience to stand as standing is bound to interrupt the exhibition of the film and would create 
disorder and confusion rather than add to the dignity of the Anthem. 

 

As in the case of the flying of the National Flag, it has been left to the good sense of the people not to 
indulge in indiscriminate singing or playing of the Anthem. 

National Tree 

 

    Indian fig tree, Ficus bengalensis, whose branches root themselves like new trees over a large area. 
The roots then give rise to more trunks and branches. Because of this characteristic and its longevity, 
this tree is considered immortal and is an integral part of the myths and legends of India. Even today, 
the banyan tree is the focal point of village life and the village council meets under the shade of this 
tree. 

National Emblem 

 

    The state emblem is an adaptation from the Sarnath Lion 
Capital of Ashoka. In the original, there are four lions, 
standing back to back, mounted on an abacus with a frieze 
carrying sculptures in high relief of an elephant, a galloping 
horse, a bull and a lion separated by intervening wheels over a 
bell-shaped lotus. Carved out of a single block of polished 
sandstone, the Capital is crowned by the Wheel of the Law 
(Dharma Chakra).  
 
    In the state emblem, adopted by the Government of India on 
26 January 1950, only three lions are visible, the fourth being 
hidden from view. The wheel appears in relief in the centre of 
the abacus with a bull on right and a horse on left and the 
outlines of other wheels on extreme right and left. The bell-
shaped lotus has been omitted. The words Satyameva Jayate 

 



from Mundaka Upanishad, meaning 'Truth Alone Triumphs', are inscribed below the abacus 
in Devanagari script. 

 

National Calendar 

    The national calendar based on the Saka Era, with Chaitra as its first month and a normal 
year of 365 days was adopted from 22 March 1957 along with the Gregorian calendar for the 
following official purposes: 

Gazette of India. 

News broadcast by All India Radio. 

Calendars issued by the Government of India. 

Government communications addressed to the members of the public. 

Dates of the national calendar have a permanent correspondence with dates of the Gregorian 
calendar, 1 Chaitra falling on 22 March normally and on 21 March in leap year.

Service Selection Board(SSB) 

Introduction 

              There are numerous ways of earning a Commission in Military, both for civilians 
(after 10+2, graduation, post graduation), as well as for serving personnel. Whatever be the 
mode, SSB is the step all have to clear, except for the medical corps. There is no limit on the 
number of attempts that can be made and the SSB Assessors encourage candidates to appear 
again for SSB.  
 
              The interview exercise is mainly a psychological assessment of the personality of the 
candidate, to gauge his/her potential as a future officer in Indian Military. The tests conducted 
by the SSB aim at selecting individuals with OLQs (Officer Like Qualities).  

 
 
              These qualities include effective intelligence, sense of responsibility, initiative, 
judgment (under stress), ability to reason and organize, communication skills, determination, 
courage, self-confidence, speed in decision-making, willingness to set an example, 
compassion and a feeling of loyalty to the nation.  
 
              Most of the tests require average intelligence. The SSB attempts to gauge the natural 
responses of the individuals. The tests are graded into various categories of both individual 
and group variety and each batch of candidates goes through the subtle testing pattern in the 
course of a few days. They are under observation not only while they perform in various 
psychological tests but even as they conduct themselves during the course of their stay at the 
SSB headquarters, where they are billeted for that duration.  
 
              The SSB Board is not concerned with the number of vacancies. Its responsibility is 
to assess and then, recommend. After recommendation, the candidates appear for Medical 

 



Examination and after that is the Merit List. Those who finally make the grade join for 
training and hence become Commissioned Officers. 

Procedure 

              The candidates who are declared by UPSC as having cleared the written exam, as 
well as those shortlisted in Direct Entries are called through Call Letters to appear for SSB 
(Allahabad/Bangalore/Bhopal/Dehradun/Mysore/Varanasi/) at the Centre allotted to the 
candidate. There have instances when the call-up letter fails to reach the candidate and the 
onus lies on the candidate to be alert and contact the office after a reasonable amount of time 
if the letter is not received when UPSC written has been cleared. Similar is the way for 
service candidates, except for that their movement is intimated to their seniors via movement 
orders. 

Day 0 (Day of Reporting) 

              SSB is a two stage process. To qualify for Stage II, a candidate needs to clear 
Screening Test or Stage I. On the date of reporting, the candidates are picked from the 
railway station and during the evening, certain Forms and also the Bio Data forms known as 

 Personal Information Questionnaire  (PIQ) are filled. PIQ is very important- there must 
be no cutting and consistency in each of the four or five copies of PIQ you are to fill. 

Day 1 (Screening Tests) 

              On the next day, is the Stage I, in which candidates are given Intelligence Test 
(Verbal and Non-Verbal), then there is a Picture Perception test, in which a slide (hazy or 
clear) is shown and then each candidate writes their story and later have a Group Discussion. 
This sequence is popularly called PPDT- Picture Perception and Discussion Test. After the 
completion of these tests, results are announced and those who do not make it in this attempt 
are dropped back to the railway station and the successful ones are retained for 4 days of 
detailed assessment. 

Day 2 (Psychology Tests) 

Thematic Appreciation Test (TAT)- Commonly known as Picture Story writing. 

 

Word Association Test (WAT) 

 

Situation Reaction Test (SRT) 

 

Self Description Test (SD), or a variation of this like description form the eyes of parents, 
teachers, colleagues, neighbors etc. 

 



 

Day 3 and Day 4 (GTO Tasks) 

Group Testing Officers (GTO) Test (Third and Fourth day)  
The following tests are conducted in this category.. 

Group discussion 

 

Group Planning Exercise (sometimes known as Military Planning Exercise)

Note:Interview :- (Held during afternoon/evening hours on 2nd/3rd/4th day) 

Day 5 (Conference) 

              On the final day, every Assessor and the candidate sit together for and have a chat- 
the fate of the candidate for that SSB is decided by the Assessors collectively there. The 
candidates are required to appear before the complete Board of Examiners comprising of 
President,Deputy President, all the psychologists, all the GTOs and Technical Officer. 
 
              After the Board Meeting of every candidate is over,the final result is declared within 

  an hour. Selected candidates are required to stay back for their medical examination (takes 

 



about 3 to 5 working days) in the Military Hospital near by or at a different place and the 
remaining candidates are dropped at the Railway Station. 

Details of the Tests 

The SSB follows a three-pronged approach consisting of three independent methods, by three 
different Officers to arrive at the most unbiased and objective conclusion:  
 
                           1.Purely psychological testing apparatus 
                           2.Outdoor test or group task officer's test 
                           3.Personal interview. 

PIQ Form: 

                On arrival at the SSB headquarters all candidates are given a questionnaire in 
which they have to fill in personal details regarding family background, educational profile 
etc. In addition this questionnaire is also a self-appraisal as some of the questions are aimed 
at gauging the candidate's opinion of him/her self. It forms a base for questions, which may 
be put to a candidate at the personal, interview stage and has importance for the psychologist 
on the Board which analyses the responses. 

Intelligence Tests: 

                Comprising both verbal and non-verbal questions are put to each candidate. It is in 
the form of a written test of the objective type with multiple-choice questions. Approximate 
time allotted for answering each question is 30 seconds. Candidates have to reason out the 
answers using common sense and intelligence on the basis of the facts given or pictures 
shown. It is presumed that a person of average intelligence does not lose the faculty of 
common sense reasoning even under pressure. Since time is important, candidates should 
leave the tricky questions for the last few minutes and attempt to answer the maximum 
number of questions. 

Word Association Tests (WAT): 

                This part of the psychological testing attempts to gauge the psychological make-up 
of the candidate on the basis of the responses of each candidate to words in everyday usage. 
As soon as a word is given a candidate is expected to formulate a sentence immediately. Only 
about 15 seconds are allowed to formulate each sentence and there are 60 words to be 
processed. 

Thematic Appreciation Test (TAT): 

                This again is a device to assess the outlook of a candidate through the medium of 
his/her responses to pictures or slides. About eight to ten such pictures are shown to the 
candidates for less than a minute and immediately after they are expected to write a small 
story based on the picture. Here again the thrust is on portraying positive traits of personality. 
The technique analyses the positive factors of the personalities of the candidates since it is 

 



felt that leaders of men can be built up from among those who already have inherent 
potential. The last slide is a blank slide, and it is often said that the psychologist reads the 
blank slide story first. 

Situation Reaction Tests (SRT): 

                The reaction of the candidates in response to everyday lifelike situations is 
analyzed. Certain instances, which may occur in the day-to-day life of ordinary individuals, 
are put to the candidates and they have to give their immediate reaction from among the 
multiple choices given. Answers are not rated in absolute terms of right or wrong; they are in 
fact weighted in the degree of correctness. Time for reaction is very short, approximately 30 
seconds and this is so because the Board wishes to analyze the spontaneous and natural 
responses of the candidates. 

Group Testing Officer (GTO) tasks: 

                The basic aim is to examine and observe candidates from close quarters in order to 
study their reactions to different tasks so as to analyze whether their thinking and responses 
on the individual plane (as revealed in the psychological testing system) tally with their 
actions in the groups tasks. There are a variety of tasks assigned in this phase.  
 
                Group discussion: A certain topic or situation is given to a group of candidates and 
they are expected to discuss the various aspects of the issue. It may be or may not be required 
to come to a decision on it, depending upon the instructions of the GTO. During the course of 
the group discussion the Group Task Officer observes each candidate- in his/her attitude as a 
member of the group, participation level, interaction with contemporaries, level of 
communication, reception to new ideas and view points alien to his/her own, ability to 
influence the group etc.  
 
                Lecturette: In this exercise each individual is given a choice of topics. Then each 
one is expected to speak on the chosen topic for 2-3 minutes during which his/her ability to 
speak extempore is observed and also the sequence of his thought processes. A logical, 
systematic sequence of thought, clarity of expression, way of holding oneself is all under 
review. A confident attitude, balanced views, easy flow and an easy stance are factors for 
success in this exercise. One should try not to fidget or move too much during the course of 
the lecture.  
 
                Group Planning: A model of a real life practical situation is presented to a group of 
candidates and they are asked to arrive at a plan of action. Initially they are asked to write 
down their own plan of action and thereafter they are expected to go over the different views 
and arrive at a consensus or group action plan. This exercise evaluates the analytical ability of 
the candidates, their ability to function in a group, appreciate the situation and plan 
accordingly. It gives an opportunity for the group to select a leader or for a leader to emerge 
in the group. Then it remains to be seen whether the leader can come up with the necessary 
qualities to carry the group towards a solution to the problem. Apart from leadership qualities 

 



this exercise also studies the group interaction level of each candidate.  
 
                Command Task: The exercise gives candidates an opportunity to assume command 
and get a task executed with the involvement of group members. The leader has to carefully 
select his/her team, assess the problem in hand and assign responsibilities to teammates. The 
exercise reveals the quality of leadership, the ability of a candidate to realize the potential of 
group members and the capacity to motivate others to accomplish a group activity. It is an 
exercise in alertness, tactical and administrative ability. It gives each one an opportunity to 
reveal his/her worth.  
 
                Individual Obstacles: In this exercise a candidate's level of physical fitness is 
gauged through a series of obstacles and activities such as rope climbing, climbing walls, 
jumping, etc. The activities are of varying levels of difficulty and performance as well as 
attitude of the candidate towards a difficult task is assessed. The SSB does not expect a 
candidate to accomplish every task or at the first attempt. On the basis of performance and 
attitude the candidate's level of physical fitness is evaluated.  
 
                Group Obstacles: Certain outdoor tasks are assigned to a group and they are 
expected to find a way out of the difficulties on the basis of group participation within the 
formulated rules. The exercise is an assessment of candidate participation in-group activities, 
planning and intelligent assessment of the situation put to the group. The Group Testing 
Apparatus thus reviews individual qualities in the context of a group. 

Personal Interview: 

                In this exercise the candidate is in direct conversation with the Interviewing Officer 
allotted to him/her. To put the candidate at ease, initial questions revolve around personal 
family background, hobbies, studies, friends, environment in which growing years have been 
spent.  
 
                The PIQ form of the candidate forms an important basis of the Interview. Some 
questions may relate to current happenings. Views on politics, religion, and nationalism may 
be sought from the candidate. Through real life situations the candidate's ability for common 
sense practical reasoning are analyzed. A balanced view with an intelligent assessment of the 
pros and cons is the best one.  
 
                Attitude towards family, friends, sports, games, hobbies, etc. are analyzed on the 
basis of the answers. In the interview a number of factors count apart from the actual verbal 
responses. The whole process of the interview right from the point of entering the room, 
manner of greeting, stance, courtesy, power of expression, attitude, manner of speaking, 
handling of difficult questions, objectivity of answers, manner of listening to a question are 
all under review and assessment.  
 
                Finally, One should never try to bluff or be inconsistent in views. A natural 

 



confident approach is the best. Ultimately it is the overall analysis of the individual's 
performance in the written examination in conjunction with the performance in the SSB tests. 
The list of recommended candidates are forwarded to the Medical Board. After clearing the 
Medical, and being successful in the Merit List, the candidate joins the training academy. For 
those who make it through this interesting challenge the future holds a lot of promise and 
national responsibility. 

Some General Points 

      1. Candidates appearing for the first time for a particular type of entry are paid 2nd class 
to-and-fro journey fare from the place of their residence to the place where they have come 
for the interview. 
      2. Accommodation and messing are free for the entire duration of their stay while 
undergoing SSB Tests. 
      3. The recommended Air Force candidates are required to go to a different place for 
medical examination on the specified date. 
      4. Air Force candidates who had applied for Pilot Entry have to first appear in Pilot 
Aptitude Battery Test(PABT). Those who are rejected in P.A.B.T cannot re-appear for Air 
Force Pilot entry again, but are welcome for other services and entries.

NSS-Spl-Camp-Guidelines 
Special Camp provides a unique opportunity to the NSS student youth for group living, 
mutual understanding, tolerance, cohesion, development of leadership qualities, bringing out 
the hidden talents of the students, etc.  To make constructive use of students’ leisure time for 
community work, these camps may be organized during the vacation i.e. Summer/Winter.

where they are holding the camps.  The duration of a Special Camp is generally Seven days.

are discussed under 3 broad heads viz., I) Pre-Camp preparation, II) During Special Camp,

social and economic development of the community.

(Annexure II) Constitution of Student Organisation

What follows is a sample constitution as prepared by the Division of Student Welfare (DSA). A legend for reading
the Constitution appears below:
Anything written in italics: Anything written in italics represents a comment by the SOC on the immediately
preceding text. There will be areas in the sample constitution we feel a desire to explain our reason for setting a
certain minimum standard, and those explanations will appear in italics immediately following the section inquestion.
Anything written in plain text: Anything written in plain text (i.e. not italics, bold, or underlined) represents those
items which must be included as part of the constitution of any Student Organization.
Anything written in bold text: Anything written in bold represents the header for the following subsection. For
example, the article numbers all appear in bold to denote that they are the headers for the sections that follow them.
(Anything written in parentheses): Anything in parentheses represents a place where we are unable to supply
standard information in plain text, as what is required is something customized for your Student Organization alone.
For example, if the phrase (insert Student Organization name here) appears, what is required is your exact Student
Organization name in place of the text in parentheses.
Your Student Organization constitution must adhere to all requirements stipulated within the Student Organizations
manual. Once completed, your proposed constitution must be approved by the SOC.

CONSTITUTION OF (INSERT YOUR STUDENT ORGANIZATION NAME HERE)
Article 1 – Name and Category
The Student Organization’s official name will be “(Insert your Student Organization name here).” No other name
will be used in the advertisement or representation of the Student Organization.
The category of this organisation is ““(Insert your Student Organization category here).”
This article is self-explanatory. You must define the exact name of your Student Organization that will be used in all
official capacities. A new Organization will be by default kept in Tier1 but SOC if desires so can keep a new
Organization in higher tiers.

Article 2 – Student Organization Mandate
(1) List all purposes for which this Student Organization will serve..
Outline and describe the planned purpose of your Student Organization. It is important that you not define your
Student Organization too narrowly or too broadly. By this we mean that you should not simply say that: “We want to
get students together to have a good time.” While this is no doubt a laudable goal, it is much too broad a mandate
for us to ratify. Your Student Organization needs a more specific reason for existing, but try not to define your
Student Organization with such a focused precision that you leave no room for growth and different ideas to emerge.
What we recommend is that you give a good, but more general outline of your Student Organization’s purpose. When
it comes to your Student Organization’s purpose and mandate, we will hold you to, and sometimes constrain you to,
what is written in your constitution, but we will not hold you to the contents of your cover letter.

Article 3 – Membership
 Membership will be open to everyone; if not read below

If membership is not open to everyone then the Organization must be having some criteria and selection
procedure for the selection of members. If such is the case then specify the closed status of membership and
the criteria along with the selection procedure in the above clause.
The criteria could be based on CGPA, Knowledge, skills, achievements etc. and selection procedure could
include shortlisting based on CV, Trials, written tests, Interviews etc. It is recommended that the procedure
should be such that it does not scare away prospective members.

 Only students at the LPU are eligible to hold membership and Organization board positions;

27 | P a g e



 The membership option will be kept open twice a year and each time for 30 days starting from the day of
commencement of academic term.
Above given is a mandate imposed by University so keep it as it is.

 The number of members will not be less than 10 and more than 250.
Above given is the rule imposed by University. You can restrict your membership strength anywhere between the
given bracket.

 Any member can leave the Organization any time after informing in written to Organization board members.
Organization can frame a different leaving policy if they desires so. Organization are expected to intimate SOC
about leaving of any member immediately.

Firstly, Student Organization membership will be by default open to everyone. If Student Organizations seek to limit
their membership according to some criteria then they will have to mention it explicitly along with the selection
procedure. Secondly, this is a University and not the community at large, and as such we require Student
Organizations to restrict Organization board and membership privileges to current LPU students only. Thirdly, a
Student Organization is permitted to take an affiliation from an Organization outside the University only after the
approval from SOC.

Article 4 – Organization Board (OB)
(1) The Organization board shall consist of the following:
a. CEO/ Director/ Editor-in-chief/President;
b. Co-CEO/ Deputy Director/ Co-Editor/Vice-President; and,
c. Treasurer.
You are not restricted to an Organization board consisting of only these listed positions, but these positions
represent the sample minimum requirements. For further help on category specific designations, students can go
through Student Organization manual. It is highly recommended that you frame the positions and responsibilities of
your Organization board members as per the requirements of the Organization. However, do not include extra
positions just for the sake of doing so. Determine what positions you can consolidate and merge. A small and
efficient Organization board can get things done better than a large cumbersome bureaucracy.

Article 5 – Responsibilities of the Organization Board
(1) The CEO/ Director/ Editor-in-chief/President will:
a. Oversee the other members of the Organization board in fulfilling their responsibilities;
b. Chair all meetings; and,

The above responsibilities represent the minimum duties required of each Organization board in order to ensure that
the Student Organization is run smoothly. Please note that these are presented as a sample and Organization are
recommended to design roles and responsibilities as per the specific requirements of Organization. You may add
responsibilities as you see fit and of course if you have added further Organization board positions, you will have to
define duties for each new position.

A promoter may or may not hold any position in the Organization Board.

the Organization.

Above mentioned is the general procedure University recommends. Organizations are expected to lay down a more

that Organization board consists of students from different years so as to smooth the transition and selection of new
Organization board at the start of a new academic session.

Article 7 – Replacement of Organization Board member

(2) Before the end of every academic session, the Facilitator along with the Organization Board will select new
Organization board that will hold responsibility from the commencement of upcoming academic session. The
new board can consist of new members or of that already existing depending on the past performance, consent
of general members, cases of passing outs and students leaving University by some other reason etc.

Above mentioned is the general procedure University recommends. Organizations are expected to lay down a more
detailed policy on the selections. The Organizations are expected to frame the selection procedure in such ways so
that Organization Board consists of students from different years so as to smooth the transition and selection of new
Organization board at the start of a new academic session. While writing this section please take into consideration
all the cases in which a position in the Organization board becomes vacant.

Article 8 – Finances
(1) No fee will be charged on membership.
As per the University rules, no membership fee will be charged on students for joining an Organization. However,
certain fundraising mechanism should be framed in case the fund is needed to conduct certain event. Such
mechanism should be mentioned in this article.

STEP BY STEP MOOC GUIDELINESS
====================================================================
Step-by-Step Guide for Students to use the Interface of 
MOOCs/Certifications  

 
Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are courses offered via various private/government 
companies and other global educational online platforms. All these courses are delivered by subject or 
topic experts with many additional features like flexible learning timings, availability of recorded 
lectures for easy and round-the-clock  access, peer-to-peer interactions, discussion forums etc. 

After the successful completion of MOOCs/Certificate Course the University has planned host of 
academic benefit ranging from relaxation in one or multiple evaluation components to even entire 
course waiver for courses registered to students in the current or upcoming academic term(s). 
Moreover, the academic benefit has been extended to the courses already completed by the student in 
his/her previous terms. 

In this regard an interface has been activated in student’s UMS account which can be assessed by 
following the path detailed below: UMS>LMS> MOOCs Certification 

 



The cases can be categorized into the following types: 
 

Category - A Where student has not enrolled himself in any MOOCs/Certifications and 
the student is curious to know about the suggestive list of 
MOOCs/Certifications which have already been mapped and approved 
for the courses of his program. 

Category- B Where the student has enrolled/completed the MOOCs/Certifications 
from the suggestive list and now he wants to apply for the academic 
benefit 

Category -  C Where the student has explored some MOOCs/Certifications beyond the 
suggestive list and now he wanted to apply for its approval and associated 
academic benefit (if any) 

 
Detailed process for each category has been summarized below: 

 
Category A: Students can view the already mapped and approved MOOCs/Certifications against the 
courses running in their schemes by following the below given steps: 

STEP 1. Log in to your UMS >LMS>MOOC/Certification, you will find a table showing term wise 
number of mapped MOOCs/Certifications. Eg. in this attached screen shot student has 5 mapped 
MOOCs/certifications in his Term 4 and similarly there are 14 mapped MOOCs /certifications 
available in  Term 6. 

 
 



STEP 2. To view the mapped MOOCs/certifications against any particular course code, student can 
use either the Search Box or he can select the course code reflecting below the search box. 

STEP 3. For any selected course code, student shall be able to see the details of MOOCs/certification like: 
 

• The name of MOOCs/certification 

• The organization offering the MOOCs/URL link 

• Proctored and non-proctoredness of the MOOCs 

• Percentage mapping of content 

• The associated academic benefit to be given after completion of MOOCs. 

STEP 4. Kindly note that the student need to get himself registered for those suggested 
MOOCs/certifications from the website of host institution /organization offering MOOCs/certification. 

STEP 5. Once the student has registered himself in the MOOCs /certification, now he can apply for the 
academic  benefit against that MOOCs by following the STEP 1 to STEP 6 to in Category B. 

Category B: 
 

If the student is pursuing /has already completed any MOOCs/Certifications from the suggested 
list of  MOOCs/Certification in his UMS then student can apply for academic benefit using the 
same path 

UMS Navigation > LMS > MOOC Certification. 
 

STEP 1. Select the course code from given courses and the information already saved shall be auto 
filled and the remaining information cells with * mark (mandatory fields) shall be filled by the student 
himself. 



 

STEP 2. Students must ensure that the information filled them is CORRECT in all respects and 
unerring. 

STEP 3. When the student has filled all the information, CLICK the save button, then he/she shall be 
asked to upload the MOOCs completion Certificate in the VIEW DETAILS tab. 

STEP 4. For those, who have completed MOOCs can upload the certificate by clicking the VIEW 
DETAILS TAB, where student needs to fill the required information along with uploading of the 
certificate in the formats mentioned there. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

STEP 5. The uploaded certificate shall be verified by authorized committee and if approved then the 
associated academic benefit shall be awarded to student by the end of the semester. 



STEP 6. In case a student has not completed the MOOCs/Certifications yet, then his/her request shall 
be kept pending and same shall be visible to student in the tab View Details. Once the MOOC course is 
successfully completed the student can upload the MOOCs completion certificate by following the 
same path UMS>LMS>MOOCS/Certification>VIEW Details. 

Category C : 
 

When a student has explored MOOCs/certifications other than the list already provided in 
UMS. 
 
The courses that appear on the list are pre-approved by your respective schools for the associated 

academic benefit. However, if you have identified any new MOOC courses that are not available on 

the portal, follow these steps: 

STEP 1. Discuss the details of the identified course with your concerned course teacher and the respective 

Head of Department (HOD). 

STEP 2. If the course is approved for academic benefit, the HOD will forward the details to your 

respective school nominee for updating on the UMS portal. 

STEP 3. Once the new MOOC courses are verified and updated on the portal, you can apply for them 

through the UMS portal and receive academic credit towards your degree. 

Note: It is important to note that no academic benefit shall be given for a MOOC course that is not 

approved by your school. Therefore, it is strongly recommended and suggested that you only register 

for those MOOCs which are available on the UMS portal and have been pre-approved by your school. 

This will ensure that you receive the associated academic credit towards your degree. 

Note: Academic equivalence/benefit approved by the Authorized Committee shall be granted to 
student only after verification of the completion certificate uploaded by the student.  
 

 
IMPORTANT: If for whatever reasons the student is unable to complete the approved MOOC or 
fails to submit completion certificate, then in that case the evaluation component(s) which had earlier 



been waived off in anticipation of MOOCs/certification completion will now be null and void (only 
for the courses of his current term) 

Based on the recommendations of the School Committee the student in such cases will be required to 
register the course as backlog/re-appear course.
